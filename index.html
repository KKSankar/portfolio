      <p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is responsible for the structure of a web page.
          For example, you can define headings, paragraphs, texts, and images in HTML.
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the style and layout of a web page.
          You can define styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, and you can even create simple animations in CSS.
          Both languages, HTML and CSS, are independent and should be saved in separate files.</p>
