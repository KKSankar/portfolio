      <p> Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is used to describe the structure of information on a web page.
        Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript make up the essential building blocks of websites,
        with CSS controlling a pageâ€™s appearance, and JavaScript programming its functionality.
        You can think of HTML as providing the bones of a web page, while CSS provides the skin,
        and JavaScript provides the brains. </p>

      <img src="images/semantics.jpeg" alt="logo describing html5 semantics" height="30%" width="30%" />
      <p> HTML5 Semantic Elements. Semantic HTML elements clearly describe it's meaning in a human and machine readable way.
          Elements such as <q>header</q> , <q>footer</q> and <q>article</q> are all considered semantic because they accurately
          describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them. </p>
