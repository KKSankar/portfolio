      <h3> <a href="https://github.com/KKSankar/1-HTML-CSS-JavaScript.git"> Html-CSS-Javascript project </a> </h3>
      <p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is responsible for the structure of a web page.
          For example, you can define headings, paragraphs, texts, and images in HTML.
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the style and layout of a web page.
          You can define styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, and you can even create simple animations in CSS.
          Both languages, HTML and CSS, are independent and should be saved in separate files. </p>

      <h3> <a href="https://github.com/KKSankar/html-css-project.git"> HTML5 Semantics project </a> </h3>
      <p> HTML5 Semantic Elements. Semantic HTML elements clearly describe it's meaning in a human and machine readable way.
          Elements such as <header> , <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately
          describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them. </p>
